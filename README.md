### Wake Up Trigger

> **what do this program?** :
> This program is a script I wrote to track my personal computer usage. It sends me notifications via Discord when the system is opened, locked, unlocked or the system is idle. The reason I chose Discord is that I can make the logs indelible with the simple authorization system and it is an MCP service that allows me to completely offload my server needs to Discord without having to make any additional settings for push notification.
